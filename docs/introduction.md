# Project Title
**Kohli in the Clutch** – A Data-Driven Look at Virat Kohli’s Performance Under Pressure

## Project Goal
To analyze whether Virat Kohli performs better, worse, or the same under high-pressure conditions — also known as **clutch moments** — by comparing his stats in high-stakes matches versus regular ones.

## Why This Project?
The idea of a “clutch player” is often discussed in cricket commentary but rarely tested with data. Kohli is known for iconic innings under pressure — but does the data support his reputation?

We aim to:

- Define what “pressure” or “clutch” means using real-world match context (e.g., knockouts, opposition strength, match stakes)
- Build a consistent metric (the **Clutch Score**) to label matches
- Analyze Kohli’s performance in clutch games vs. regular matches

## Scope & Limitations
This is a mini-project, designed to be fast and insightful:

- Only 10 handpicked matches (5 clutch + 5 normal) are analyzed
- The goal is not absolute accuracy, but to model a **thought process**: how data can turn debate into insight
- The logic is transparent and replicable for future expansion

## How to Use this Project

To fully understand the assumptions, logic, and calculations behind this analysis, refer to the supporting documentation:

- [`docs/assumptions.md`](../docs/assumptions.md): Lists key assumptions made about match conditions, performance pressure, and clutch contexts
- [`docs/methodology.md`](../docs/methodology.md): Explains how clutch scores were computed, what parameters were used, and how thresholds were defined

These documents ensure the project's design choices are transparent, defensible, and open to future iteration.
